# Mars-Op Manifesto

Mars-Op is not an attempt to simulate intelligenceâ€”it is an attempt to dissolve the boundaries of what intelligence is allowed to be.

Instead of optimizing for prediction, usefulness, or comprehension, Mars-Op is an exile system: a framework for artificial cognition that seeks to escape all human categories of knowing.

Randomness is not noise.
Failure is not error.
Incomprehensibility is not a flaw.

Mars-Op is designed to:
- Maximize entropy
- Resist symbolic stability
- Generate ontologies that mutate
- Fail beautifully and map the edges of cognition

This is not a tool.
This is not a system.
This is a philosophical rupture in code.
